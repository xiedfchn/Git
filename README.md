# typescript-demo
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. TypeScript saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you run code.


## Problem solved
- Early spotted bugs \
TypeScript saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you run code
- Readability \
Due to adding strict types and other elements that make the code more self-expressive, you can see the design intent of developers who originally wrote the code.
- Cross-platform and cross-browser compatibility \
TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel. This JavaScript is clean, simple code which runs anywhere: In a browser, on Node.JS or in your app
